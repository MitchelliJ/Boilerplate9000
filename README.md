# Boilerplate9000

# How to use

1. Use create_project_spec.md to create a high level overview of the project.
2. Use create_coding_guidelines.md to set the standards for your project.
3. Use create_feature_prd.md to create a PRD for small projects or features
4. Use generate_tasks.md to make a to-do list

This will create neccessary documents in the /vibes directory. You can then:

5. Start a new conversation for each generated PRD, lead the conversation with the generated documents for context and tell it to finish the to-do list.
6. Sip coffee while AI builds your app

‚ú®I encourage you to fork this repo and customize the prompts to your own project needs and prompting style.‚ú®

## Tips

- Explicitly prompt the AI to follow the instructions in the files.
- Start new conversations for each feature.
- Lead the conversation with generated coding guidelines, project spec and feature PRD.
- Review all generated files closely before letting the AI execute.
- Unit tests for each module
